# Portfolio* requires composer, npm, and bower### Getting StartedHow to setup on localhost:1. git clone repository. ```/public``` directory is the documentroot. Change all files under ```/storage``` to be writable. Might need to add directives to nginx config file for pretty URL.2. create ```.env.local.php``` in parent directory and add database credentials for local development. If on production(live) server, use ```.env.php``` instead.ex.```php<?phpreturn array(    'DB_NAME' => 'dbname',    'DB_USERNAME' => 'username',    'DB_PASSWORD' => 'password');```3. run ```composer install```.  Then ```bower install```.NOTE: ```npm install``` has been removed from composer.4. run ```php artisan migrate```5. DONE![SITE](http://www.rhgksrua.pw)
